    <h1> Tennis is fun </h1>
    <h2> Tennis keeps you active</h2>
    <h3> it also teaches you focus</h3>
    <h4> Its pays a lot of money</h4>
    <p>"Tennis is a mind game played with yellow balls and over-engineered racquets.  

It's fun to see if you can hit the shot you want and it's fun to anticipate what your opponent will do but have a counter punch prepared to win the point.

The point system rewards those players who do well under pressure.  Unlike baseball or volleyball, you don't just count up the points at the end of the match to see who wins.

Tennis is a game that can be played and enjoyed at any age, by any skill level.  And, you don't have to have all the "shots" to win at it.

It is the oldest organized game known to western culture.  It has lasted for good reason -- it's fun for a variety of players.

Lastly, it can be highly addictive (to watch) because at the pro level, it comes down to one winner at any tournament."
